Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) are fundamental graph traversal algorithms used in artificial intelligence and computer science. BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node and visiting all adjacent nodes before moving to the next level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be visited next. BFS is often used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, as it guarantees that the shortest path to each node is explored first.
On the other hand, Depth-First Search (DFS) explores the graph by traversing as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of nodes to be visited next. DFS is particularly useful for problems involving backtracking, such as finding connected components in a graph, cycle detection, or solving puzzles. While BFS guarantees finding the shortest path, DFS is more memory efficient and can be more suitable for problems where the solution is deep in the graph. Both algorithms have time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
